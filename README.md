I noticed you guys have been pretty lit on github lately and thought maybe we attempt something once again.

Maybe we can brainstorm and agree on an idea, then we just start a to-do list of sorts using *issues* and the project function for this repo.
If someone feels inclined to try and close an issue/to-do item, just go ahead and try. I thought this might be a low pressure way for us to atually build something together from the distances we are apart, using github as the mode of communication in addition to being the *hub* of all our work.

Please refer to the projects tab of this project where we'll build out a plan. starting issues allow us to comment on the tasks together so get in ther and get commentin

Go crazy here yall admins

I am down to discuss more somewhere more efficiently ie text/discord/email/telegram
