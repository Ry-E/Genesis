Discription? Excellent question.

#### Sup brahs
I noticed you guys have been pretty lit on github lately and thought maybe we attempt something once again.

Maybe we can brainstorm and agree on an idea, then we just start a to-do list of sorts using the issues of this project.
If someone feels inclined to try and close an issue, just go ahead and try. I thought this might be a low pressure way for us to atually build something together from the distances we are apart, using github as the mode of communication in addition to being the *hub* of all our work.

I am down to discuss more somewhere more efficiently ie text/discord/email/telegram
